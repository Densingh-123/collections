## What is the Collections Framework?

The **Java Collections Framework** is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable data structures. It provides algorithms and utilities to perform operations like searching, sorting, and modifying collections easily.

### Key Features:
- **Reusable Data Structures**: No need to implement your own lists, maps, or sets.
- **Flexibility**: Choose from multiple implementations (e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`).
- **Performance**: Optimized for efficiency in terms of time and space.

## Hierarchy of Collections

The Collections Framework is organized into a set of interfaces and classes:
